# REFLECTION

  During the development of my portfolio using VSCode and GitHub, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow as a developer. One major challenge was managing version control effectively on GitHub. At first, I struggled with understanding the proper workflow of committing changes, pushing to remote repositories, and resolving merge conflicts. To overcome this, I took time to learn basic Git commands and explored GitHub’s documentation and tutorials. Using VSCode’s built-in Git integration also made the process smoother by providing a visual interface to stage changes, commit, and sync repositories, which significantly reduced my errors and improved productivity.

  Another challenge was setting up the project environment and previewing changes locally. Initially, I wasn’t familiar with live server extensions in VSCode, which slowed down my ability to quickly see the impact of code edits. Once I installed and configured the Live Server extension, my workflow improved drastically, enabling me to test and debug the portfolio in real-time without repeatedly refreshing the browser manually.

  For future improvements, I plan to enhance the portfolio by adding more interactivity and responsive design features to make it user-friendly across all devices. Integrating automated deployment through GitHub Actions could streamline publishing updates seamlessly. Additionally, incorporating better documentation and commenting within the codebase will make future edits easier, both for myself and others who might collaborate on the project. Overall, working with VSCode and GitHub was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of web development and version control.
